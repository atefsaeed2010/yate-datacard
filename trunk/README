		YATE - Yet Another Telephony Engine
		-----------------------------------

  The YATE project aims to be a fully featured software PBX.
  
  It was created to alow developers and users to have more functionality and
  scalability. To reach this goal YATE is built from two kinds of components: 
    1. The main engine - telengine.
    2. Modules - routing modules
               - drivers
               - script language bindings
	       - billing modules
  
  Its license is GPL with exceptions (in case of linking with proprietary
  software). We have chosen this license to help the growth of this project.


Building YATE Modules
---------------------

These are generic instructions for building a Yate module. For specific
modules their developers may add extra information.

YATE have been tested on Linux and Windows and was ported to FreeBSD.
Please report bugs at bugs@voip.null.ro

To build and install a Yate module the quick way is:
  ./configure
  make
  make install

Yate must be already installed.
